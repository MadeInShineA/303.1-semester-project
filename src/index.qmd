title: "303.1 Semester Project:<br>Extending DIPY's Generalized Q-ball Imaging model to make predictions"
---

This semester project focuses on advancing diffusion MRI analysis by contributing to the DIPY library. Specifically, it extends the Generalized Q-Sampling Imaging (GQI) model with a new `predict` function that enables signal reconstruction and prediction for unseen gradient configurations. Through rigorous implementation, testing, and documentation, the project aims to enhance DIPY's capabilities in neuroimaging research.

## Project Overview

This project is part of the [303.1 semester project course](https://isc.hevs.ch/learn/enrol/index.php?id=123){target="_blank"}.

The goal is to contribute to the [DIPY](https://dipy.org){target="_blank"} framework by extending the Generalized Q-ball Imaging (GQI) model with predictive capabilities.\
The key objectives are:

- Implementing a `predict()` function to the `GeneralizedQSamplingFit` class
- Thoroughly documenting the new code
- Providing comprehensive and meaningful tests
- Getting the prediction pull request accepted by DIPY

The project has progressed to the point where a pull request has been submitted to the DIPY repository for integrating the new `predict` function.
This pull request is currently under review by the DIPY development team, and feedback is being incorporated to ensure it meets the library's standards and requirements.
You can track the progress at [DIPY Pull Request #1](https://github.com/oesteban/dipy/pull/1){target="_blank"}.
